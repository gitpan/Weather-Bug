=head1 NAME

Weather::Bug - Provide an object oriented interface to the WeatherBug API.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Weather::Bug version 0.20


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Weather::Bug;

    my $wxbug = Weather::Bug->new( -key => 'YOURKEYHERE' );
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Weather::Bug module provides an object-oriented wrapper around
the WeatherBug web API. An object of this class performs requests and parses
the output to provide an easier interface for retrieving weather information.

Use of this module requires registering with WeatherBug to acquire a license
key. This key provides a developer with access to the API.

=head1 INTERFACE

The module supports several methods that access the WeatherBug API. In
addition, the module supports a few convenience methods that simplify
access to the underlying functionality by other classes.

The object is created using the C<new> class method. It takes a single
required named parameter B<-key>, whose value is the license key you obtained
from WeatherBug.

The constructor also supports an optional parameter B<-getsub> whose value
is a C<coderef> that works as a standin for L<LWP::Simple::get>. This is useful
for testing, or if you need to get your data from somewhere other than an
HTTP request.

=head2 WeatherBug API Methods

These methods provide high-level access to the WeatherBug API.

=over 4

=item list_stations

This method takes one parameter, a US I<zipcode> giving a start location
to look for WeatherBug stations. The method returns a list of
L<Weather::Bug::Station> objects representing the stations near the
requested location. The definition of I<near> and the number of stations
returned depends on the density of stations in the area of interest.

On failure, the method returns an empty list.

=item get_forecast

Retrieve the 7-day forecast for the supplied I<zipcode> as a
L<Weather::Bug::SevenDayForecast> object.

On failure, the method returns C<undef>.

=item get_alerts

This method takes one parameter, a US I<zipcode> giving a location to check
for alerts. The method returns a list of L<Weather::Bug::Alert> objects
representing alerts that apply at the current time.

If there are no alerts, the method returns an empty list.

=item get_live_compact_weather

This method requires two named parameters: I<zipcode> and I<StationID>. The
method provides access to what WeatherBug refers to as I<Live Compact Weather>
as a L<Weather::Bug::CompactWeather> object.

=item get_live_weather

This method requires two named parameters: I<zipcode> and I<StationID>. The
method provides access to what WeatherBug refers to as I<Live Weather> as a
L<Weather::Bug::Weather> object.

=back

=head2 Convenience Methods

These utility methods are used by some of the other Weather::Bug
classes to do their work. Some of these methods may be used for lower-level
access to the WeatherBug API.

=over 4

=item request

This method takes two parameters, a C<cmd> name and a hash containing
parameters to pass to the command.

The C<cmd> parameter is the filename used in the URL for that API method,
without the extension. Supported commands are:

=over 4

=item getStations

=item getFullForecast

=item getLiveWeather

=item getLiveCompactWeather

=item getalerts

=back

This allows an extension point in the class. If WeatherBug extends their
API, this method can be used to make a call in the same way as any of the
other methods.

Using this method, the URL is created mostly automatically including the
hostname, the file extension, and the I<acode> parameter supplying the
license key.

On success, the method returns the body of the response as a string. On
failure, the method C<die>s.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

This section lists error messages that this module may display.

=over

=item C<< Request for '%s' failed. >>

The request to the WeatherBug API was not successful. The C<%s> is the
name of the page that failed.

=item C<< Unable to parse output from '%s' request. >>

Although the WeatherBug API did return successfully, the output could not
be parsed as well-formed XML. The C<%s> is the name of the page that failed.

=item C<< No '%s' node found. >>

Although the WeatherBug API did return successfully, the output XML did not contain
the specified node.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Weather::Bug requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This module depends on C<Moose>, C<LWP::Simple>, and C<XML::LibXML>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
