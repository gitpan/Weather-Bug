Revision history for Weather-Bug

0.24  Wed Mar 25 19:30:00 2009
       Joseph Hull reported that WeatherBug had apparently modified the
       format of the date string in the getFullForecast response. Used this
       opportunity to move from a regex hack to DateTime::Format::Builder.
       Code now supports new format and old, in case they move back to the
       old format.

       Correct more installation errors: missing dependencies on what
       I believed to be core modules. CPAN Testing corrected.

       Correct installation errors: missing test files and dependency.
