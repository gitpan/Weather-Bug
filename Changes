        Gordon Child provided a patch for a Moose warning issue that began
        appearing sometime since the last release. In the process, he replaced
        the dependency injection approach used for changing the request code
        with an inheritance-based approach.

       Joseph Hull reported that WeatherBug had apparently modified the
       format of the date string in the getFullForecast response. Used this
       opportunity to move from a regex hack to DateTime::Format::Builder.
       Code now supports new format and old, in case they move back to the
       old format.

       Correct more installation errors: missing dependencies on what
       I believed to be core modules. CPAN Testing corrected.

       Correct installation errors: missing test files and dependency.
